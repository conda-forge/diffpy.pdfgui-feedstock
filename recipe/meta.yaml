  description: |
    The diffpy.pdfgui package provides a graphical user interface to pdffit2 refinement engine, 
    with many powerful extensions. It is a GUI program for structure refinements to atomic pair 
    distribution function. It is capable of full-profile fitting of the atomic pair distribution 
    function derived from x-ray or neutron diffraction data and comes with built in graphical and 
    structure visualization capabilities.
